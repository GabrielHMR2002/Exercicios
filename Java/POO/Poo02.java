/*A company has its own employees and outsourced employees.
For each employee, it is desired to record the name, hours worked, and hourly rate. Outsourced employees also have an additional expense.
The payment for employees corresponds to the hourly rate multiplied by the hours worked, with outsourced employees receiving a bonus equivalent to 110% of their additional expense.
Create a program to read data for N employees (N provided by the user) and store them in a list. After reading all the data, display the name and payment of each employee in the same order they were entered.
Build the program according to the project on the side. See an example on the next page. */
